This talk is going to be about lucid dreams. Does anyone knows what
"lucid dreaming" means?

If, yes, "Can you explain it to the other students in a few words", else:

Ok, then. "Lucid dream" is a dream in which you are aware that you are
dreaming. How many of you have experienced it? Ok, can someone share what
he/she does when knows he/she is dreaming? Ok, before we explore lucid dreams
in depth we should talk about dreams in general.

## Dreams

We're going to answer three main questions about dreams.

- What are dreams?
- Why dreams are so weird?
- Why we forget easily our dreams?

### What are dreams and why we dream?

As we all probably know one average sleep process is separated into several
stages. We are interested in in the REM sleep which is responsible for
dreaming. REM, by the way, stands for Rapid Eye Movement and
this is because during the REM sleep the sleeping person's eyeballs
move quickly all over the place. During REM sleep certain parts of our brain
are blocked. These parts are responsible mainly for our movement, so, we
cannot, for example, move our legs when we dream we are running. But other
ones, for example, our taste receptors are still active and that is why we
experience so real taste in our case.

REM sleep is very healthy because during it there are happening some useful
processes in our brain, for instance, we remember what we have studied about
that night or even we improve our sports skills. During that stage
our brain is orgainising all the information we have received during the
day, making connections between them and our previous memories and getting
rid of what we don't need. So, these electrical impulses are detected by our
part of the brain which is responsible for our consciousness, and our brain
confuses and tries to make a story from all the information. And this
is our dream.

### Why dreams are so weird?

This partly explains why our dreams are so strange and random. They're not
supposed to make sense, they are just parts of our memory, thoughts and
emotions. As I already said, our brain is trying to make a story of them,
but the part which is doing this is the right one.

You all probably know that the brain can be separated in two
parts - left and right. The left one is more structural and analytical, it is
responsible for logic, numbers, words and so on; while the right one is for
colors, design, imagination, emotions and so on. So, when our **right** side
is more active in our dreams they are more strange and illogical.

### Why we don't remember our dreams?

So, many of you could argue that they don't have dreams, but it is estimated
that during a normal REM sleep each person experience 3 to 7 different dreams.
However, we are forgetting them very quickly, actually after 10 minutes we
have forgotten about 95% of our dreams, the largest part is forgotten in the
first seconds. What's happening? We don't remember most of our dreams because
we actually don't want to. We have something like a detector in our brain
which says whether something is important or not and just doesn't let the
brain to remember some useless details.

## Back to lucid dreaming

Knowing already what are dreams and how they work, we can go back
to the lucid ones.

We said that the lucid dreams are the ones when the dreamer is self-aware.
This awareness, combined with the freedom our right side of the brain gives us,
provides us endless opportunities. We said that our brain is trying to make
a story from all the thoughts and memories, and emotions, in order they to
make sense in some way. But when we know we are dreaming we can control that
process and do things which are impossible or very hard in the real life.
Some examples for activities in lucid dream are:

- Flying
- Teleportation
- Some personal things, for instance, reliving real-life memories
- Some epic things such as fighting with dragons and so on

However, even that in most cases people chose these activities, if we want,
we can achieve even more, making this kind of dreams more useful, such as:

- Resolve fears and nightmares
- Perfect sports skills
- Talk with someone about your life goals
- Practice public speaking
- Practice foreign languages

And even some crazy ideas like these ones:

- Become invisible and try to see your reflection at the mirror
- Grab your eyeballs and try to see yourself
- Have a lucid dream in a lucid dream

The only thing that limits us is our imagination, you can think of many
ideas and experiments about your own lucid dreams.

The ability of having these kind of dreams is actually trainable, you can
learn having lucid dreams when you want to. Some people have achieved to have
at least 4 lucid dreams every night. Also, this ability is not limited just
to certain type of people, everyone can learn it.

However, it is not that easy. It requires time, persistence and motivation.
Some people learn it just in several weeks, for others it takes them months.

There are many techniques to achieve this skill, which in most cases differ
just in some little detail. There are some common steps that I'll tell you.

- Keep a dream journal. It improves your ability to recall dreams and your
memory during a dream. Every time when you wake up write down everything
you remember even if it doesn't make any sense. You can use also pictures
and everything that helps you to express yourself.
- Reality checks.
- Begin to think about recent dream and imagine it becoming a lucid one.
- Repeat to yourself every night "I will have a lucid dream" and try to
plan what you are going to do in it.

There are also some advanced techniques such as keeping your mind aware
while your body falls asleep. However there are some risks here, such as
some strong feels of fear and hallucinations.

Lucid dreams can be used even for a so-called "dream therapy" which can help
psychologists to analyse their patients more easily. Although it's illegal.
